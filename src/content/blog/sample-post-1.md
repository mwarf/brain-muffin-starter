## What’s Brewing for 2025?

Here’s the scoop on five AI tricks that are shaking things up.

### 1. AI-Powered Personalization

Imagine your videos knowing exactly what your viewers love—like a friend who always picks the perfect gift. AI digs into the data and serves up stuff like spot-on product recs, no guesswork needed.
