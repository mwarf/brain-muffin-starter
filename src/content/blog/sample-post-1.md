## Hello World!

Welcome to the official blog of BrainMuffin, the AI VFX department of Coalbanks Creative Inc.

Here, we plan to share our journey exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and visual effects. Expect to find posts covering:

*   **Industry Trends:** How AI is shaping the future of filmmaking and video production.
*   **Experiments:** Our adventures in testing new AI models and techniques.
*   **Thoughts:** Musings on the creative and technical aspects of AI in VFX.
*   **Project Case Studies:** Deep dives into how we've leveraged AI for specific client projects (when possible).

We're excited to share our learnings and contribute to the conversation. Stay tuned!
